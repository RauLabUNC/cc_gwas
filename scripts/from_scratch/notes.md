## About
This markdown is here to help track the process of reassembling the QTL mapping pipeline.

## Scripts

#### `SCRIPT_NAME.ext`
*Purpose* Briefly describe what the script does, key options, and when to use it.

*Expected inputs*:
- `path/to/dependency_1` - what it is and why itâ€™s needed
- `path/to/dependency_2` - description
- `path/to/input_{paramA}_{paramB}.ext`- note on templated parameters

*Generated outputs*:
- `path/to/output_{paramA}_{paramB}_{feature}.ext` - description of result
#### `snakemake/01_ropScan.R` 
*Purpose*: Executes a genome scan from the miQTL package on a given trait. Has options for different sample aggregation (i.e. taking the average of a group or not), which treatment group to consider (`drug`), and which normalization to use for the input trait measures (could be removed, since we've already established that Box-Cox is the move)

*Expected Inputs:*
- `scripts/extras/scan_h2lmm.R` - modified form of an `miQTL` function to fix a long forgotten error
- `data/raw/genomes/haplotype_cache_cc_083024` - Happy-style genotype information 
- `data/processed/phenotypes/boxCoxTest/{norm}_{agg}_{drug}.csv` - {brackets} are reflecting the snakemake format for the inputs. This is the phenotype information

*Outputs*: 
- `data/processed/ropscan/{norm}_{agg}_{qtl_trait}_{drug}.rds`

*Action items* 
- Add conditional argument that enables both treatment and control groups to be used when performing scans of baseline traits that were recorded before iso-pump implantation
    - need to specify which traits to use
    - Compare results of each approach (pooled versus split baseline measures)


#### `snakemake/02_permTest.R`
*Purpose* Set significance for genome scans generated in `ropScan.R` by performing many, many scans different random permuations of the trait measures

*Expected inputs*:

*Outputs*:
- `data/processed/scan_thresholds/{norm}_{agg}_{qtl_trait}_{drug}_threshold.rds` - a single numeric threshold value (not sure if -log10(p-value) or LOD score), above which is significant
- `data/processed/scan_thresholds/{norm}_{agg}_{qtl_trait}_{drug}_perm.rds` - Full permuation object. Currently not again used, but takes a long time to generate and would be useful if we wanted to try new thresholds or compare thresholds between traits

## August 29th, 2025 Progress

Major pipeline integration completed:
- Removed all PyLMM dependencies throughout pipeline
- Created modified versions of scripts 13 and 22 without PyLMM
- Fixed circular dependency between scripts 13 and 21
- Integrated makeLociPackets.R as final pipeline step
- Symlinked bulk expression and NRVM data from original project
- Fixed SLURM logging to only output in date-specific directories
- Added LD_LIBRARY_PATH workaround for InterMineR

**Blocking issue**: MouseMine appears to be offline/retired - InterMineR cannot connect for phenotype annotations

## August 27th 
Started this approach. Created the `scripts/snakemake` folder, which is for scripts that were run through snakemake previously.
